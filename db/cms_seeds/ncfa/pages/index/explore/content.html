ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure)

[markdown description]
**ENCORE highlights how businesses may be exposed to accelerating environmental change. Start by selecting any economic sector or production process below to explore natural capital risks.** Please note that, in order to avoid double-counting, ENCORE only lists direct potential dependencies and impacts of production processes on ecosystem services and natural capital assets, excluding dependencies and impacts that occur through the supply chain. This means, for example, that the potential dependencies listed for the ‘Production of paper products’ process, excludes the potential dependencies related to growing and harvesting wood products, which are covered under forestry-related processes. The same applies to potential impacts of ‘Production of paper products’
