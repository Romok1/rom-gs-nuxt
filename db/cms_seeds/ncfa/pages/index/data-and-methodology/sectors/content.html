Sectors

[markdown description]
Sectors represent broad divisions of the economy. There are 11 sectors in the Global Industry Classification Standard. These are further broken down into sub-industries and production processes.

[markdown content]
Economic sectors were classified according to the Global Industry Classification Standard ([GICS](https://www.msci.com/gics){:target="_blank"}) which comprises a four-level hierarchical structure with 11 sectors, 24 industry groups, 68 industries and 157 sub-industries. Sub-industries were further broken down by production processes to capture dependencies within each process which may not be captured at the sub-industry level, for example the chemicals sector includes a number of processes, such as fractional distillation, with potentially different ecosystem service dependencies.
