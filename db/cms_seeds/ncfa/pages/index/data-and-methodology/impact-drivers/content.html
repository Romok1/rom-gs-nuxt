Impact Drivers

[markdown description]
An impact is different to an impact driver. Impacts are “changes in the quantity or quality of natural capital that occurs as a consequence of an impact driver. A single impact driver may be associated with multiple impacts” (Natural Capital Protocol, 2016<sup>1</sup>).

[markdown content]
In accordance with the Natural Capital Protocol (Natural Capital Coalition, 2016<sup>1</sup>), impact drivers are defined as: a measurable quantity of a natural resource that is used as an input to production or a measurable non-product output of business activity.

The descriptions below are quoted directly from the Natural Capital Protocol. Through the literature reviews conducted as part of the research for ENCORE the following additional impact drivers were also identified for certain production processes and are yet to be included in the database underpinning the tool: biological alterations/interferences, positive impacts, socio-cultural impacts.
