Materiality

[markdown description]
Each sector dependency on ecosystem services was assessed, using sector research and expert interviews, to determine materiality, as Very High, High, Medium, Low or Very Low. The addition of materiality ratings allows financial institutions to determine which ecosystem services are more critical to production processes, and allows users to explore which services are most relevant for further analysis.

To assess the importance of the contribution an ecosystem service makes to a production process, and the materiality of the impact if this service is disrupted, two aspects were considered:


1. How significant is the loss of functionality in the production process if the ecosystem service is disrupted?
    * **Limited loss of functionality:** the production process can continue as is or with minor modifications.
    * **Moderate loss of functionality:** the production process can continue only with important modifications (e.g. slower production or use of substitutes).
    * **Severe loss of functionality:** Disruption in the service provision prevents the production process.

1. How significant is the financial loss due to the loss of functionality in the production process?
    * **Limited financial loss:** Disruption to the production process doesn’t materially affect the company’s profits.
    * **Moderate financial loss:** Disruption to the production process materially affects the company’s profits.
    * **Severe financial loss:** There is a reasonable possibility that the disruption in the production process will affect the financial viability of the company.

The materiality assessment reflects both these considerations. A very high materiality rating means that the loss of functionality is severe and that the expected financial impact is severe as well.
