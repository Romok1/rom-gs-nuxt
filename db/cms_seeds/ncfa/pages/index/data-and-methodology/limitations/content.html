The ecosystem service factsheets were not developed based on location-specific information. Financial institutions and businesses are encouraged to integrate, apply and adapt the broad information gathered here for each individual project risk assessment. Shifting supply chains to a different country to manage impacts on natural capital assets is also not captured in this framework, but these mitigation efforts could be captured in individual risk assessments by financial institutions or businesses.

The framework for assessing the importance of natural capital assets and influence of drivers of environmental change should be used as a general guideline. It is possible that the importance or influence may change according to the specific context. Similarly, it is possible that the materiality of ecosystem services to production processes shows some variance across contexts or over time.

The ecosystem service factsheets and assessments of importance and influence include the main drivers of environmental change influencing or impacting natural capital assets, but there are likely also a number of other possible drivers of environmental change. These are captured as grey boxes in the summary tables within each of the factsheets.

A new version of the Common International Classification on Ecosystem Services framework, V5.1, has recently been published. Although there are differences between this and the version used in this project (V4.3), it does not alter the overall interpretation of ecosystem service provision through natural capital assets. A cross-walk table between V4.3 and V5.1 is available [here](https://cices.eu/){:target="_blank"}.

Data sources are collected and curated in a wide variety of languages, so it is unlikely that all available data sources have been identified.

The data sources identified represent the best available data at the time. However websites providing access to data sources may not be accessible indefinitely and more up-to-date datasets may become available.

Many of the spatial data sources identified within the inventories may require technical skills or Geographical Information Systems knowledge to use.
