Zinc is expected to see a potentially high relative change in demand, however, due to the concentrated applicability in energy technologies, it has higher demand uncertainties as technological disruption and deployment could significantly impact its demand.",World Bank (2020),https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/207371500386458722/the-growing-role-of-minerals-and-metals-for-a-low-carbon-future,,,,
