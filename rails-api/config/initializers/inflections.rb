# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1en'
#   inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'
#   inflect.irregular 'person', 'people'
#   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
# end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
  # it means any files with gef in become e.g. GEFProjects, instead of GefProjects
  inflect.acronym 'GEF'
  inflect.acronym 'CSV'
end
