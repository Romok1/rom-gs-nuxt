          ecoIntegrityRisk: Higher scores show areas with a higher ecological integrity risk value, meaning there is a greater opportunity to increase the overall intactness of ecological communities within those areas through implementation of appropriate biodiversity management and restoration.
          star: Higher scores show areas with a higher STAR value, meaning there is a greater potential to reduce species extinction risk in those areas.

                tooltip: "The Potential to Reduce Species’ Extinction risk shows the STAR (Species Threat Abatement and Restoration) metric value for the portfolio. A higher score means the portfolio overlaps with a larger proportion of the ranges of more species that are more severely Threatened. This means the portfolio has greater opportunities to contribute towards reducing species extinctions through implementation of appropriate management practices (see ‘Actions towards potential portfolio alignment’ section below). STAR data are provided to the ENCORE platform from the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT), in which users can generate bespoke risk screening reports based on asset locations, and access data on Protected Areas, Key Biodiversity Areas and the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, including STAR."

                description_2: 
                  agriculture: "The average is determined by calculating an average STAR/hectare of agricultural land across your input portfolio. This is then compared to a global average of country-level STAR/hectare of agricultural land (based on the administrative area with the highest amount of cropland in each country). This aims to give a broad overview of the relative potential for reducing species' extinction risk based on the countries associated with the portfolio."
                  mining: The average is determined by calculating the average mine value at global level and relating this to the size of the input portfolio. For example, if the average mine’s STAR score is 20 and there are 10 mines in the portfolio, the average would be 200. Results are listed as roughly equal to average if they are within 5% of the average value.

              title: Portfolio breakdown by ecoregion status
              intro: This section displays the ecoregion categories associated with your input portfolio. Each ecoregion has been assessed for its trend in ecological integrity and its trend in protected area coverage, and has been assigned an alignment category based on these combined values. Please note that economic activities in each ecoregion category are not de facto aligned or non-aligned. Alignment can only be achieved through implementation of appropriate management actions as outlined in the table below.

Ecoregions with protected area coverage above 30% and with an increasing trend in ecological integrity are considered to have a higher likelihood of meeting global biodiversity goals."
