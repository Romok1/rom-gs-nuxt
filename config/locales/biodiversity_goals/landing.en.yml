      open_cards_intro: '<strong>Important notice</strong>: this module uses goal-relevant metrics, but does not currently provide an explicit link to global biodiversity goals in the developing post-2020 global biodiversity framework as this is yet to be formally agreed at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP-15). This module will be updated in accordance with the final negotiated text of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework once this text is available.'
