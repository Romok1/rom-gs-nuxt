              intro: Use this section to understand the distribution of the values in species extinction and ecological integrity risk metrics associated with your portfolio. The table provides additional granularity by displaying the information by ecoregion and country by sub-national administrative boundaries for STAR and by ecoregions for ecological integrity risk.

            title: Sector-level future exposure scenarios
            tooltip: Use this section to understand which commodities in your portfolio are likely to see demand increases due to their links to the energy transition. Alongside this you can view the species extinction and ecological integrity risk metric values associated with these commodities at the sector level. This helps gain an understanding of potential biodiversity risks associated with current and future extraction.
            section_one:
              heading: Portfolio commodity overview
              text: This breakdown shows the different commodities associated with your portfolio. It highlights whether these commodities have been assessed as required to support the energy transition, meaning demand for them is likely to increase in future.
